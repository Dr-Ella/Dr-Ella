## Hi there 👋
Welcome to my GitHub! I’m passionate about data-driven decision-making, especially in healthcare, business, and non-profits. With expertise in Excel, SQL, and Python, I turn raw data into actionable insights that drive real-world impact.

🔍 What I Do in Data Analysis
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Uncovering trends and insights from structured and unstructured data. ✔ SQL & Database Management – Writing optimized queries for data extraction and transformation. ✔ Data Visualization – Communicating findings through Excel ✔ Business & Financial Analytics – Using Excel models and forecasting to support decision-making.
Beyond data, I leverage my skills in grant writing, executive assistance, and copywriting to support research, funding, and business strategies.
